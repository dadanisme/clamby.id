          agreement and understanding between you and us. Our failure to
          exercise or enforce any right or provision of these Legal Terms shall
          not operate as a waiver of such right or provision. These Legal Terms
          operate to the fullest extent permissible by law. We may assign any or

          provision or part of a provision of these Legal Terms is determined to
          be unlawful, void, or unenforceable, that provision or part of the
          provision is deemed severable from these Legal Terms and does not
          affect the validity and enforceability of any remaining provisions.
          There is no joint venture, partnership, employment or agency
          relationship created between you and us as a result of these Legal
          Terms or use of the Services. You agree that these Legal Terms will
          not be construed against us by virtue of having drafted them. You
          hereby waive any and all <strong>defenses</strong> you may have based
          on the electronic form of these Legal Terms and the lack of signing by
          the parties hereto to execute these Legal Terms.
